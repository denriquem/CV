## Daniel Martinez-Gatell

As an cognitive neuroscientist, when I started coding, something clicked. The combination of creativity, logic and seeming like a fingerprint of our own thought processes, made me fall in love with coding.

I've always loved learning and stretching myself accademically. I currently have a paper on decision making in paranoia under review for publication. Tech seems like the perfect place to permanently learn and code seems like the perfect medium see fast paced growth and the product of your work.

## Projects

- [Moovli](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/moovli): Final project at Makers, where you can click on any country and get the best movies from that country. 
- [DreamCatcher](https://github.com/denriquem/dreamCatcher): Individual side project - a full stack MERN app where you can share and interpet your dreams with friends.
- [Acebook](https://github.com/denriquem/acebook--TeamFavouriteFriendLove-): a social media webpage that allows users to post messages onto each others walls. Users can edit and delete their  posts and interact by viewing other users home pages. 
- [Boris Bike Challenge](https://github.com/denriquem/Boris_Bikes_JS): A program that emulates the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure of the boris bike system in order to practice the fundamentals of object oriented programming in javascript. 

## Skills

#### Discipline

In order to complete a degree in nueroscience and a masters in social cognition I had to work incredibly hard for long periods of time. I regularly worked 14 hours a day seven days week whilst managing to look after myself. I would regularly be confronted with a piece of work or paper that I didn't understand. Through hard work and perseverance I would break down the unintelligible paper into key concepts which I would research independently to then piece the puzzle together.


#### Curiousity

Being genuiniely open and curious led me into science, where I could delve into the inner workings of the mind and brain. For me, curiousity entails a flexibility, openness and bravery to consider different perspectives and hypotheses. During my previous role as an operational scientist and during Makers, curiosity has allowed me to explore a range of topics that I wouldn't have expected to be initially interested in. For example, during my time working for Cambridge Cognition, in addition to researching the validity of cognitive tests, I started reseaching the role of stress on cognitive performance as a side project which resulted in this blog post: https://www.cambridgecognition.com/blog/entry/can-stress-at-work-affect-cognitive-performance
