## Daniel Martinez-Gatell

As an insatiably curious cognitive neuroscientist, when I started coding, something clicked. The combination of creativity, logic and seeming like a strange fingerprint of our own thought processes, made me fall in love with coding.

I've always loved learning and stretching myself accademically. I currently have a paper on decision making in paranoia under review for publication. Tech seems like the perfect place to permanently learn and code seems like the perfect medium see fast paced growth and the product of your work.

## Projects

- Moovli: Final project at Makers, where you can click on any country and get the best movies for that country. https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/moovli
- Acebook: a social media webpage that allows users to post messages onto each others walls. They can edit and delete their own posts and interact by viewing other users home pages. https://github.com/denriquem/acebook--TeamFavouriteFriendLove-
- Bank Challenge: https://github.com/denriquem/bank_challenge/tree/master/coverage

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Discipline

In order to complete a degree in nueroscience and a masters in social cognition I had to work incredibly hard for long periods of time. I regularly worked 14 hours a day seven days week whilst managint to look after myself. I would regularly be confronted with a piece of work or paper that I didn't understand. Through hard work and perseverance I would break down the unintelligible paper into key concepts that I would research indpendently and then I would piece the puzzle together.


#### Curiousity

Being genuiniely open and curious led me into sciecnce, where I could delve into the inner workings of the mind and brain. For me, curiousity entails a flexibility, openness and bravery to consider different perspectives and hypotheses. During my previous role as an operational scientist and during Makers, curiosity has allowed me to explore a range of topics that I wouldn't have expected to be initially interested in. For example, during my time working for Cambridge Cognition, in addition to researching the validity of cognitive tests, I started reseaching the role of stress on cognitive performance as a side project which resulted in this blog post: https://www.cambridgecognition.com/blog/entry/can-stress-at-work-affect-cognitive-performance
